Have the function to find nearest Fibonacci numbers, that the parameter is array.

**Example Input**: 

```jsx
arr = [15,1,3]
```

then your program expected to made **output = 2**

**Why Output is 2?**

Because by the above input example **[15,1,3]**, if we add up them it will **15+1+3 = 19**, 
and the nearest **fibonacci of 19 is 21**, 
so we need to **add 2 then it can be 21**. So, the correct answer is 2.
